# POC-FILEPOND

I discovered `Filepond` recently, a simple library for uploading files to a server. With many plugins available, the functionnalities of the libraries can be enhanced.

## Running

For running the project, use the command in the _package.json_:

```bash
$ nx run-many --parallel --target=serve --projects=app,server
```

## System

Ubuntu Version: Ubuntu 22.04.2
Node Version: v18.12.0

```bash
# Get the version of node
$ node -v

# Get the latest version of ubuntu
$ lsb_release -a
```
